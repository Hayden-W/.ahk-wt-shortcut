# .ahk-wt-shortcut
Autohotkey script that launches various windows terminal profiles from keyboard shortcuts.

Mostly here for when I inevitably forget about it, reinstall windows, and remember to back it up as the hard drive wipe completes.

Why use an AHK script instead of Window's built in shortcuts? because they're terrible.

You'll need AHK for this: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Add a shortcut to your startup folder for ease of use.
